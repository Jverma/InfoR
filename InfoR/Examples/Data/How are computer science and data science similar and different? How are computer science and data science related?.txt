A2A. Data science is software development skills plus maths. But computer science is a much broader subject and so is maths. Data scientists program computers in various computer languages (Python, Java, R etc.) and have good knowledge of data structures and algorithms. Data science involves building models based on machine learning which is a subfield of computer science. Some data scientists also work on Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Data scientists use advance technologies like Hadoop, relational and NoSQL databases, which built by computer scientists. A lot of data scientists have advanced degrees in computer science where they learn some of these skills. Though a computer science degree is not necessary, huge amount of data scientists come with educational background in statistics, physics, economics etc. But programming is a core aspect of data science. A lot of data scientists study data generated on web, tech companies consume a big proportion of data scientists.
