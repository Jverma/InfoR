Worth it, if you ask me! Well, it depends on how you measure the worth. Nevertheless, with a PhD in Computational biology, you can - Pursue academic research at a university. Pursue research at national labs like LBNL, LLNL, Los Alamos Lab, NIH, Cold Spring Harbor Lab etc. Pursue research at IBM, Microsoft, Genentech/Roche, Monsanto (maybe!), NASA, DE Shaw etc. Work at a software developer or a data scientist at a technology or financial company. The coding and computational skills have a wide applicability. Work for startups in bioinformatics and genomics e.g. one of the coolest startup at the intersection of genomics and computer science is Counsyl. Some very influential people on quora like Sam Sinai, Paul King, Yohan John, Bradley Voytek, Sang Young Noh have or are studying to get [edited after Sam's comment below] PhD degrees in computational aspects of biology. They all write very enlightening answers in their subjects.
