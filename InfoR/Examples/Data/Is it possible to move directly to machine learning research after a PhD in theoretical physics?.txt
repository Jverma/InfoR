It is surely possible to move to ML from theoretical physics and as one answer suggests, in some cases people have done remarkably well. The only bottleneck could be to convince some lab to accept you, this is going to be especially challenging when it comes to Google Research or MSR. If your publications are in computational physics that can make things a bit easier. I have a background in theoretical physics and pure mathematics, and I'm currently working as a machine learning researcher in a bioinformatics lab. I spent one year studying machine learning and statistics, programming (Python, R), collaborated with a machine learning professor on a project, did some independent projects and convinced this lab to offer me a job. That being said I'n not at Google or MSR! At these companies, you will be competing with people with PhDs in relevant fields. A very close friend, who finished PhD in pure mathematics, just joined Aspera (an IBM company) as a researcher. So it is indeed possible.Advice would be to work on some projects, preferably research level and highlight those in your applications. Good Luck!!
