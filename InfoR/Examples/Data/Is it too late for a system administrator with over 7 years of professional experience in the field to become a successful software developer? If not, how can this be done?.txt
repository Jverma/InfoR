Thanks for A2A. It is not late, it never is! I exclusively studied mathematics and physics for 8 years, then decided to pursue a career in software and analytics. I spend one year learning coding, reviewing statistics and other technologies. A very close friend finished his PhD in theoretical mathematics and is currently working as a software developer. I would suggest start with Python, it is super easy to learn and you can do pretty much everything in python. I'm a bit biased towards python, surely there are lots of other options. Learn the python-Django framework. Django is one of the most successful web frameworks built on python. A quick search on LinkedIn of StackOverflow would yield thousands of developer jobs for a Python/Django engineer. You can try to built simple web apps with Django, there is plenty of material on the web to help you through this. Also CodeAcademy is an excellent resource. If you interested in web development, take time to familiarize yourself with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
