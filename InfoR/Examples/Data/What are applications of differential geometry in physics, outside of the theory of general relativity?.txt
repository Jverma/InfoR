Gauge Theories Yang - Mills and Maxwell's equations are the equations for the connections on a principal bundle which for Maxwell is  and for Yang-Mills is . (See also Instanton).Topological Field TheoriesHamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics. (See Symplectic manifold)Supersymmetry (relation to Morse Theory).Theory of fermions and lot more. (Spin geometry)People also study quantum field theories on higher dimensional manifolds where differential geometry play an important role. e.g. higher dimensional spheres arise in many examples of AdS/CFT correspondence.
