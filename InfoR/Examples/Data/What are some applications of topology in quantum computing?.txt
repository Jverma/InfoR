A2A.Topology is applied to build a theoretical quantum computer, Topological Quantum Computer. The idea is that the qubits are modeled by quantum particles in 2 dimensions called anyons, whose world lines form braids (Braid theory). These braids form the logic gates for the computer. The quantum state of the system depends only on the topological state of the braids which is classified by the braid group. Thus the computations are robust to small perturbations as these perturbations can change the quantum state but the word line (logic gates) will be stable. This is an important advantage of toplogical quantum computer over the 'traditional' quantum computers. P.S. This is related to an amazing quantum phenomenon Fractional quantum Hall effect.
