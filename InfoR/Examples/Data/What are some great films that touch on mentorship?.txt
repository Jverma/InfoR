Excellent answers so far! The Count of Monte Cristo (2002 film) which is an adaptation of the novel of the same name written by Alexandre Dumas has a great portion dedicated to mentorship. Edmond Dantes (the protagonist), while captive in the prison, is trained by a fellow prisoner (a priest) in mathematics, literature, philosophy, economics as well as in fighting and strategy. P.S. - I've seen about 5 adaptations of this book, but never felt satisfied with the treatment of the mentorship part. I guess the actual revenge story sells more than the preparation for the revenge!
