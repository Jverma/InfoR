I'll go old school - 1. Guide (film) (undoubtedly the best Hindi movie ever made). It is based on the novel of same name by R.K. Nayaran, starring Dev Anand, Waheeda Rehman. 2. Kaagaz Ke Phool - Masterpeice by Guru Dutt. 3. Anand (1971 film) If you are interested in modern bollywood (signing-dances-romance), my take is 1. Jab We Met2. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara3. Dev.D
