Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) is an open source file format for storing huge amounts of numerical data. Its typically used in research applications (meteorology, astronomy, genomics etc.) to distribute and access very large datasets without using a database. One can use HDF5 data format for pretty fast serialization to large datasets. HDF was developed by National Center for Supercomputing Applications.Think of HDF as a file system within a file. It lets you organize the data hierarchically and manage large amount of data very efficiently. Every object in an HDF5 file has a name, and the are arranged in a POSIX  style hierarchy with / separators.e.g. /path/to/resourceHDF5 has two kinds of objects - Groups DatasetsGroups are the folder like objects which contain datasets and other groups. Datasets contain the actual data in the from of arrays.I have written a couple of blog posts on HDF5 file format : HDF5 processing in PythonHDF5 to JSON converter in Python
