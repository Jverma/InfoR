Klein - Gordon equation is the relativistic version of Schrodinger equation however KG equation is second order in time derivatives. The solutions of KG equation correspond of quantum spinless particles. Whereas Dirac equation is first order in time derivative as Schrodinger equation. Dirac equation also describes quantum spin 1/2 particles. As for the relation between them, Dirac equation can be thought as the square root of the KG equation. Any solution to the Dirac equation is automatically a solution to the KleinGordon equation, but the converse is not true.
