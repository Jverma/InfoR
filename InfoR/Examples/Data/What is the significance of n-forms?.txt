Differential forms provide a coordinate independent framework for calculus in higher dimensions. On a manifold there can be (usually there are) more than one choice for coordinates but the geometry is independent of what choice we make. It is really important to have the coordinate-free approach to calculus. Differential forms on a manifold form an algebra and this allows us to do study geometric properties algebraically (which imho is much easier and far more transparent).Differential forms have many applications in topology, geometry and physics. Integration over manifolds. The fundamental theorem, Green's theorem, Divergence theorem, Stokes' theorem are all special cases of a unified result stated in terms of forms. Many more general statements. Easier way to computer cohomology (topology) of a manifold via De Rham theory. Intrinsic way to define orientation, volume, symplectic structure, spin structure etc.  Theory of electromagnetism and other gauge theories.
