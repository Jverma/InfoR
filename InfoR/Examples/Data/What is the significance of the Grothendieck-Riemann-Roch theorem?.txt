GRR is an extremely important result in algebraic geometry.Classical Riemann-Roch theorem relates the complex geometry of a holomorphic line bundle on a compact Riemann surface to its purely topological invariant (genus). Hirzebruch proved a generalization of R-R to higher dimensional complex manifolds (complex algebraic varieties) and higher rank holomorphic vector bundles. GRR is a generalization of Hirzebruch RR. GRR expresses this relation as a property of a morphism between two schemes (complex manifolds) and instead of vector bundles, we have complexes of sheaves (vector bundles). This results is very significant - It is an example of the Grothendieck school of algebraic geometry - "express everything as a property of morphism" (Grothendieck's relative point of view).The statement is more general but the proof is simpler. (as always the case with G-interpretation of classical results).GRR uses category theory and techniques from homological algebra to express a theory in complex analysis. Very important step in the development of current algebraic geometry. Introduction of K-groups and beginning of algebraic K-theory. Useful in the development of Atiyah-Singer Index theory.If you are writing a new framework for algebraic geometry, make sure you prove a generalization of GRR!!
