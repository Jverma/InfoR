The tangent space to an algebraic variety, called Zariski tangent space, is the algebraic avatar of the tangent space of a manifold in differential geometry. Let  be ring (sheaf) of functions on a scheme (or variety) . If  is a point (prime ideal of the ring), then  is a local ring. Now a local ring has a unique maximal ideal, say . Then the Zariski cotangent space of  at  is defined as . Notice that this is a vector space over the residue field . The dual of this vector space is the tangent space. This is an intrinsic way to define the tangent space, it doesn't depend on any coordinate charts. This definition makes complete sense for differential manifolds also (use ring of differentiable functions)!
