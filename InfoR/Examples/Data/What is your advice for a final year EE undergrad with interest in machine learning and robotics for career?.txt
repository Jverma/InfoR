If you want to pursue your career in India, you are in a good situation. You have done courses in relevant topics like Linear Algebra, Optimization, machine learning etc., that's a good start. You can either go for option 1, I'm sure a lot of companies in India are looking for software engineers with knowledge of machine learning. There you will get opportunities to hone your machine learning skills and you can try to climb up the ladder to the research units. Or you can get an MS in a school in India with a focus on machine learning and robotics, e.g. IIIT-Hyderabad is an excellent choice. They also have good faculties for research in NLP. Then you can either work in India or can come to US for PhD/job. Other option is to try get an internship (RA) position at Microsoft Research India or at IIIT-Hyderabad and then apply to schools in US for a MS/PhD. With your background in IIT and research experience in the relevant field at good labs, you stand a good chance of getting into top-tier US machine learning departments. A PhD from a US university will help you launch your career in machine learning R&D. Many graduate students in good US schools do summer internships at various companies. I know people who worked their summers at Google research, MSR, IBM research etc. This is a great advantage which will help you get research jobs upon graduation. Hope this helps.
