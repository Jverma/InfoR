While writing this, sitting in a local coffee shop, smelling freshly roasted beans, sipping a beautifully crafted espresso macchiato, marveling at the geometry of the white porcelain mug, I am wondering what a life without coffee would be!Coffee comes in a wide range of tastes and textures. There are also numerous ways to brew coffees and you have options for a coffee-based beverages. This variety is one of mail reasons for my interest in coffees. Coffee is a great drink which I can enjoy drinking alone and the fun is raised manifold when I'm with friends. The coffee shops are an amazing hang-out places. Coffee shops are my favorite places to work, especially when I've no reason to go to office. Over the years, I've adapted to be more productive while working at coffee shops. I like the atmosphere at coffee shops - the aroma of coffee, the movements of baristas, the voices of people - all tell me "you are not alone!"
