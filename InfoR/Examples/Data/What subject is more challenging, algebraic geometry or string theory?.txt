Ron Donagi once told me - "String theory is just algebraic geometry!"String theory is an area of theoretical physics which tries to unify quantum theory with the theory of gravity. Whereas Algebraic Geometry is a branch of mathematics which unifies algebra and geometry. It is hard to compare these two subjects, any two subjects for that matter! Some people have an aptitude for physics and they find string theory easy to comprehend than algebraic geometry. Most of physicists I interacted with, feel this way. Whereas mathematicians have trouble swallowing the concepts like path integrals, renormalization, anomaly cancellations etc., they find algebraic geometry much more concrete and easier to follow. Both string theory and algebraic geometry are challenging subjects, require huge background and at least 2 semesters of coursework to understand the basics. As someone who has studied both of these subjects, I found the courses in string theory easier to follow than the ones in algebraic geometry. This probably is due to the fact that I had strong background in QFT and Gravity while I sucked at commutative algebra. Also I was too (differential) geometric in my approach. Algebraic geometry challenges your intuition, especially theory of schemes. String theory was built on QFT & GR and save for higher dimensions, there were not many counter-intuitive concepts.
