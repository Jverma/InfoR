Here is a list of Clay Math Institute's research fellows : Clay Mathematics InstituteAll young, recent PhDs with excellent research work. Another name I would like to append to this list is Sarkar - home. Sucharit has done great wok on Heegard-Floer theory which includes a couple of papers in Annals in Mathematics. Also, the smartest mathematics undergrad I knew is Bao's webpage who is finishing his PhD at Harvard. I'm sure he is doing amazing research. (I don't understand the field to know the impact of his work).
